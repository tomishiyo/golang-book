This are my attempts at solving the exercis proposed in the introductory book
an Introduction to Programming in Go by Caleb Doxsey
(https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)

A word of caution: the author appears to use an older version of Go, so
some concepts in the late chapters (refering to compiling packages) do not work.

A useful source that helped me with that was
https://linguinecode.com/post/how-to-import-local-files-packages-in-golang

Also I'm not sure if I should stage .mod files. Will check it in other projects.
